description: What I realized from not being able to find the sesame oil in my kitchen
---

During winter break, I was making myself a well-deserved post climb meal at 11 PM. This 'dish' is super simple, only requiring 3 eggs, rice, sesame oil & soy sauce. I'd eat it all the time growing up, as my dad was an insufferable cook who refused to not cook for his kids.

As I was cooking my 3 eggs, I started to look for the sesame oil (which in my opinion is the most imporant component of the dish as its my favorite part). I checked our sauce container, the kitchen counter, pretty much everywhere you could imagine, but I couldnt find it anywhere. Becuase the eggs were almost done & my incompetency at multitasking, I gave up on finding the sesame oil and sat down at my kitchen table. 

And of course, literally sitting right in front of me was the sesame oil.

Yea, I realize I'm talking about a bottle of sesame oil here, but for some reason it really got me thinking about all of the things that I accidentally look past in my life.

Weirdly enough, I feel like I've found successs right after giving up in a lot of instances in my life. Jobs, relationships, etc. Why is this the case?
I'm describing this series of events: 

> trying -> trying harder -> giving up (failure) -> finding success/ finding the solution (often times, a suprisingly simple one at that)

The world around us constantly tells us never to give up. Dont get me wrong, I mostly agree with this! Chase after the things that you're called to follow and do your thing. But sometimes, we can get caught up in this misconception that the harder we try to be sucessful, the more sucessful we'll be. Then when we don't find success after trying harder, we look inside to figure what we're doing wrong. Then, we say "ah, im not trying hard enough!" and go right back to square 1. 

Clearly, that approach is flawed enough that even a bottle of sesame oil proved me wrong.

Now, am I then saying we should give up after a certain point? No. 

I just think after awhile, we should switch up the way we look at things. So I guess going back to the sesame oil situation, "giving up" on finding it wasnt *actually* giving up. It was more of a "i cant find this now and dont have the time to because otherwise the eggs will burn, so im going to find it after im done cooking the eggs even if that means the food might go cold". Hopefully that makes sense. 

All I'm trying to say is that just "trying harder" in all honesty can ironically be kind of a lazy / brute-force way to approach the problems in our lives. For me, it often puts me in a mental box that severely limits my line of sight. And maybe it has the same effect for you. 

This is kind of a weird example, but I really see this weird phenomenon of the mental box/giving up take place during my technical coding interviews. When I try to force myself to try to think harder about possible solutions, I end up just stumbling over my words and repeating the same thing over and over again with no clear thoughts running through my head. 

So I guess you might be wondering: **what are other ways to approach those situations?**

Trying to convince myself or reminding myself about why the problem matters to me helps a lot in 'giving up' aka looking at the problem from a different perspective. Now, for some situations like the sesame oil it might feel a little silly to try and make yourself feel convicted about that. But then at the end of the day, if you're really taking the time & effort to think about this stuff, you clearly care enough.

So yea, why do you really care about ***x***? Take your answer & run with it. At least that's what I've done. 

The best we can do to find what we are looking for sometimes is to just step away (whatever that means to you / in the situation). Somehow, stepping back offers an undeniable clarity that allows us to step out of the box that we unreasonably force ourselves into. I wonder why we do that.

Here's to looking at the bigger picture, and to hopefully finding the sesame oil of our lives!
