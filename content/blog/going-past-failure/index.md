description: What I realized from not being able to find the sesame oil in my kitchen
---

During winter break, I was making myself a well-deserved post climb meal at 11 PM. This 'dish' was super simple, only requiring 3 eggs, rice, sesame oil & soy sauce. I'd eat it all the time growing up, as my dad was an insufferable cook who refused to not cook breakfast for his kids.

As I was cooking my 3 eggs, I started to look for the sesame oil (which in my opinion is the most imporant component of the dish). I checked our sauce container, the kitchen counter, pretty much everywhere you could imagine, but I couldnt find it anywhere no matter how hard I looked.

    Pause, im not trying to sound dramatic here.
    it wouldve really sucked if i had cooked all 3 of those eggs
    just to not be able to find the sesame oil. plus, i was hungry.

A couple of minutes later, as I sat at my kitchen table with my cooked 3 eggs in a bowl in defeat, I saw it. Quite literally sitting right in front of me, a bottle labeled "sesame oil".

I felt so incredibly stupid.

Yea, I realize I'm talking about a bottle of sesame oil here, but for some reason it really made me think about all of the things that I accidentally look past in my life. 

Often times, the things that we are looking for in life is sitting on the other side of success, right next to failure. As I've grown older, I've developed this misconception that the harder you try to be sucessful, the more sucessful you'll be. Clearly, that proposition is so stupid that even a bottle of sesame oil will prove me wrong.

Ive found that "trying harder" often puts me in a mental box that severely limits my line of sight. And maybe it has the same effect for you. 

This is kind of a weird example, but I really see this weird phenomenon take place during my technical interviews. When I try to force myself to try to think harder about possible solutions, I end up stumbling over my words and repeating the same thing over and over again with no clear thoughts running through my head.


So I guess you might be wondering: **what is the correct way to approach those situations?**

I've found that trying to convince myself or reminding myself about why the problem matters helps a lot. At the end of the day, if you're really taking the capacity to think about this stuff, you clearly care about the stuff that's on your mind. Why do you care? Take that and run with it! At least that's what I've done.

Sometimes, the best we can do to find what we are looking for is to step away. This is applies to a lot of different aspects of our lives (Relationships, jobs, friendships etc.), at least in my life. Somehow, stepping back offers an undeniable clarity that allows me to step out of the box that I unreasonably force myself into. I wonder why I do that.

Here's to looking at the bigger picture, and to hopefully finding the sesame oil of our lives!
