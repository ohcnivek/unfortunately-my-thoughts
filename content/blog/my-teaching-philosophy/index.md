I love teaching. If you know me decently well, you know that being a teaching assistant has played a pretty large role in my life in college. 

This semester will be my 5th and last semester as a ta for the college computing at Georgia Tech, and I want to take some time to reflect on what I've taken away during that time. 

### 1. Zooming in & out

Whenever students come up to me in office hours and say:
>  ***"I dont understand **_____**. Can you explain it?"***,

It's a bit overwhelming. Without a clear idea of what they actually dont understand / do understand, it's pretty hard to explain a topic to someone without just rambling on about random things and hoping it covers what they were asking about. So this is what I do to help myself get a better understanding of what they don't understand.

Learning is kinda of like a sandwich. It builds on top of itself, and I like organizing things in my head as layers. 

For example, to understand the concept of exponents, one needs to know how multiplication works, and to know how multiplication works, one needs to know how addition works. The mental model I'm thinking of is a stack. Without fully understanding addition, it's impossible to fully understand multiplication, which then makes it impossible to fully understand exponents.

| to understand:      | Exponents |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Prereq      | Multiplication       |
| Prereq to the prereq   | Addition        |


Essentially to figure where this stack "breaks", we just dive down until we hit the bottom or a firm foundation (in this case, addition). From there, we build back up. For example, we "zoom in" aka ask "do you understand multiplication" (if they do, "do you understand addition") until we find where their mental stack got jumbled. Once we find the break point, we "zoom out" and restructure/ rebuild their learning stack, until we hit the topic that they dont understand. Very similar to debugging code.

It sounds really simple and almost too obvious, but its worked for me pretty well both as a teacher and a student.

### 2. Bullet-Proof Memory

I have a pretty horrible memory. After multiple years of trial and error, I've found that really the only bullet-proof way to hold onto ideas/ concepts is to fully understand something top down bottom up. When you take the extra time when learning something to fully understand what happens at a level below & above, it really nails it down in your brain. 

A good thing that's helped me with this asking: 
> how/why is what im learning an intuitive solution to _____? 

Note: This question has particularly helped me, someone studying computer science, because everything we learn is/was just an intuitive solution to a moderately complex problem. I dont know. Its helped me a ton, hopefully it helps you.

### 3. Learning should be intuitive, when teaching is done right

Pretty much the otherside of what I was talking about before. When we teach, we should try to make answering the question, **"how/why is what im learning an intuitive solution to _____"** as easy as possible for the students.

    
### 4. Not asking the simple questions -> Inevitable lack of understanding

I hate asking dumb questions in front of other people. It feels like a waste of my time & a waste of everyone else's time.

But, what must be done must be done.

I've found that it's when I'm too prideful to ask these simple questions early on that leaves me eventually thinking: "wow i actually didnt understand a single word that was just said" in lecture on a monday morning. Really crappy place to be in on a monday. Having a firm foundation is important. 

note to self: Don't let pride get in the way of learning!

### Last words:

I'm a strong believer that anyone can learn anything, and my approach to pedagogy revoles around this belief. I'm ever grateful for the educational opportunities I've been blessed with growing up, and I want to help bridge the educational gap in whatever way I can.

So yeah. If you have the opportunity to teach in a formal or informal setting in your community, do it! Plus, I would not have gotten my first job without it on my resume, and I wouldnt have my current job without my first job.

#### in case you were wondering about my credentials: 
- helped teach object oriented programming (cs1331) at the georgia tech college of computing (may 2020 - dec 2020)
- helped teach data structures & algorithms (cs1332) at the georgia tech college of computing (jan 2021 - now {jan 2022})
    - "We love Kevin! :)" - fall 2021 anonymous student feedback
    - "He was genuinely a very nice guy. Explained things very well." - fall 2021 anonymous student feedback

not much, but its honest work :)

again, please take everything on this blog with a massive grain of salt. im 21. you are probably much smarter than me.
