I had a conversation a couple of months ago about sitting in the car in silence with someone. 

I feel like it's pretty safe to say that many people feel uncomfortable sitting in silence with someone in the car. To break that silence, we inquire about their lives / ramble on about our lives to fill that silence. The typical "how long have you been driving for uber" etc. And in the middle of that, you go through multiple painfully awkward pauses while frantically scrambling through the depths of your brain for related conversation topics to the last one. 

But usually, people have a couple of special people in their lives theyre okay sitting in silence with. Usually, the ones they're closest to. 

I wonder why that is. Isn't it kind of weird? It almost seems counterintuitive to me at the surface â€” wouldnt we want to have more intentional conversations / an authentic curiosity to inquire about your loved ones in the car? 

So here are a few reasons why I think we feel the way we do. 

### reason #1: less overthinking

I've wondered what people who've been married for 50 years talk about at dinner after talking about what they did that day. Do they just reflect back on old times and talk about memories? 

Personally, I think it's because we know it's fine. After a certain amount of time, we know it's fine to go somewhere in silence (also when I say in silence with some music playing / without talking). We know that they won't get offended. We know that it doesnt mean that we dont care about their day/ lives. If anything, they honestly probably appreciate it after all of the bs they probably had to listen to during their day. 

### reason #2: comfort -> doing only whats necessary 




### reason #3: we appreciate genuity behind questions / conversations the closer you are to someone
