Hey. My name's Kevin. I'm from Daejeon, S. Korea & have been in Atlanta for quite some time now. I like art history, climbing, creating, coding, teaching... a lot more.

I created this blog because ... I've made a lot of mistakes, and I will continue to make them until my last day on earth. So why not share the lessons and realizations ive taken away from them? Shame is a powerful thing. It often times pushes us from being vulnerable and sharing our mistakes and lessons with others â€” the very thing that helps us build relationships. So this is my attempt at driving out & offsetting shame's effect on my life with vulnerability.

Hopefully, me sharing & writing down some of my thoughts and realizations will help someone else out. 

Do keep in mind, I'm 22 - chances are that you are probably a lot wiser & smarter than me. So please do share your thoughts & stories with me if you want! I'd love to hear them.
