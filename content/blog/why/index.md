To be honest, I don't know. Maybe I like to talk too much, or maybe I like to vent too much. Either way, I'd like to clarify a couple of things before you jump into reading any of my random thoughts.

1. Is the purpose of this blog to share my wisdom? **no.**
2. Is it to tell you what to do? **no.**
3. Am i smart or qualified enough to do either of those things? **absolutely not**

I just like sharing what I'm thinking about, and I don't like putting people in the uncomfortable position where they're forced to listen to me. This way, it'll be completely optional! I think about a lot of random stuff, and this is just a really convienient/cool way for me to vent and connect with those who feel the same way. So yea! I guess I can introduce myself a little bit.

My name is Kevin. I'm 21 (almost 22 oh my), and right now, I'm a student at Georgia Tech (as of jan 2022). This summer, I'll be at Meta as a Software Engineer Intern in San Francisco, California. Previously, I was at Delta Air Lines as a Software Engineer Intern on the In-Flight Entertainment team + traveling the world!

I'm very passionate about learning new things, and sharing those things with the people in my life. Feel free to reach out to me about anything, always!
