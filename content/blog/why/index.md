To be honest, I don't know. Maybe I like to talk too much, or maybe I like to vent too much. Either way, I'd like to clarify a couple of things before you jump into reading any of my random thoughts.

1. Is the purpose of this blog to impart my wisdom? **no.**
2. Is it to tell you what to do? **no.**
3. Am i smart or qualified enough to tell you what to do or impart widom unto you? **absolutely not lol**

I just like sharing what I'm thinking about, and I don't like putting people in the uncomfortable position where they're forced to listen to me. This way, it'll be completely optional! I think about a lot of random stuff, and this is just a really convienient/cool way for me to vent and connect with those who feel the same way. So yea! I guess I can introduce myself a little bit.

My name is Kevin. I'm 21 (almost 22 oh my), and right now, I'm a student at Georgia Tech (as of jan 2022), but this summer, I'll be at Meta as a Software Engineer Intern in San Francisco, California. Previously, I was at Delta Air Lines as a Software Engineer Intern on the In-Flight Entertainment team + traveling the world!

I'm very passionate about learning new things, and sharing those things with the people in my life. If you're one of my past students reading this or if you have any questions about any of my thoughts/ blogs, feel free to reach out to me about anything, always!
