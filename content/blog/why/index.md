Hey. My name's Kevin. I'm from Daejeon, S. Korea & have been in Atlanta for quite some time now. I like art history, climbing, creating, coding, teaching... a lot more.

I created this blog because ... I've made a lot of mistakes during the past 22 years of my life, and I'll continue to make them for many more. So why not share the lessons and realizations I've taken away from them? Shame is a powerful thing. It often times pushes us from being vulnerable and sharing our mistakes and lessons with others â€” the very thing that helps us build relationships. So this is my attempt at driving out & offsetting shame's effect on my life with words.

Hopefully, me sharing & writing down some of my thoughts and realizations will help someone else out. 

Do keep in mind, I'm 22 - chances are that you are probably much wiser & smarter than I am. So please do share your thoughts & stories with me (if you want)! I'd love to hear them.
