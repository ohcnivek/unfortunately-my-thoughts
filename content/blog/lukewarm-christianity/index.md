description: "The inner dialogue "
---
I would like to preface this by saying that I'm by no means innocent of any of the things I talk about in this. If anything, this is pretty much my inner dialogue from different points in my life. I use "we" a lot in this, because it just sounds more natural & makes it feel like I'm actually talking to someone else about it instead of myself.

> "Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately important." - C.S. Lewis

I love this quote ‚Äî mainly because it applies a binary lens to a category of our lives that we would often describe as anything but binary. 

As Christians, if we truly believe in all that the bible says is true, our faith should be of utmost importance. On the contrary, if we didnt actually believe in it, there's absolutely 0 point in wasting our time on the idea of Christianity. Right? What purpose would moderately following Christianity serve? 

### Lukewarm Faith: Why do we do it, if we know it's wrong?
I'm making the assumption here that we feel convicted that lukewarm faith is wrong.

To answer this, I think we need to answer this first: ***"What purpose would 'moderately' following Christianity serve?"***

It's the idea of doing the minimum while maximizing the benefit. It's the whole "buy low sell high" thing. Except "buying low" is settling for lukewarm faith, and "selling high" is the getting into heaven + having unlimited phone a friends (God) in dire emergencies. 

At least that's how it works in my head. We justify that it's ok because we luckily serve a good & merciful father, who looks past our transgressions. I really don't think I'm the only one that feels guilty after thinking like this. It almost feels like I'm taking advantage of God.

### Not Treating Faith as a Transaction
I think this is mainly the reason why faith is always the first thing to go. When you have a busy monday coming up, Sunday service is the first thing to go. Because we are pretty much trained to put our time into things that will yield the maximum/ most rewarding result. And when the 'rewards' of being extremely devoted Christian, arent very tangible we convince ourselves its ok to chip away at our faith just until the point when we can still say we're Christian enough to get all the benefits, but not Christian enough to sacrifice the least amount of our time and will power.

So how should we approach our faith differently from our financial decisions / investments?

Well first, we can outline why your faith is different from a typical investment:
#### 1. The 'value' of your investment will never change. 
As in God will never change (Psalm 100:5). This renders the idea of "buy low sell high" pretty useless. It's not possible to buy low and sell high because one, it is already at the maximum and second, the 'thing' that we are buying into will never change, and will always be there.

#### 2. This 'investment' is a particularly big one, one you are commiting to for the rest of time. That's a really long time.
> The last stars will die out 120 trillion years from now (at most) followed by 10^106 years of just black holes. Condensed, that's like the universe starting with 1 second of stars and then a billion billion billion billion billion billion billion years of just black holes. Stars are basically the immediate after-effects of the Big Bang. A one-second sizzle of brightness before settling into an essentially endless era of darkness. We live in that one bright second. - Tim Urban

Isn't that crazy? It just puts into perspective how minute and brief our current reality is. And then comparing that feeling with the cosmic scale of the universe & time? Just really makes you think.

#### 3. The 'investment' is a relationship. Not an actual investment
So lets treat it that way - no need to be so serious about it ü§ôüèº

### So what do we do?
So how do we not do this? And not just that, but continue to not revert back to lukewarm faith?

To be honest, I think it really goes back to treating our faith as the difference between life and death, and not desensitizing ourselves to the truth our faith offers. So far, I've found doing these things to be helpful (this is a running list):

- Arguing with myself as to why I keep falling into lukewarm faith & finding the source of the cycle. 
- Actually reading the bible by following a plan
- Actively thinking: God has a plan for today (this one is from Louie Giglio)
- Commiting time to invest in a Christian Community (whether that's yl, your church, co etc.)

### This is hard

Yea, I think it's really hard too and literally everyone else does too. And that's ok ‚Äî in the end, we undeservingly are loved by a perfect, merficul God who forgives. Just trying our best is somehow enough. And that's the good news!
