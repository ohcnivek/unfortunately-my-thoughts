The other day, I was cleaning out some of my old drawers at home and found the script of my speech about taking risk from my high school's Senior Night of Inspiration. As I read it again, I got a chance to reflect on the past 2.5 years of my life through the lens of my 18 year old self. 

Here's an excerpt from it:  

> "They say: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars”. Well, I’m here to say nah. You defintely do not land in the stars- you land on the ground. Failure and disappointment stings and for such driven and motivated students like you guys, it’s often discouraging and disorienting. 

> ***But***, there is quite nothing like realizing your worst fear. This disappointment and discouragement - our failure to become who we aspire to be, our failure to become our percieved ideal self - this misfortune offers clarity and often times true conviction when we are adrift and fogbound. And this disappointment and chance for self realization is only made possible when we dream big." - kevin, circa 2019


For the most part I agree with Kevin circa 2019, but I also think I left out some really important stuff (because I didnt realize these things 2.5 years ago).

### some realizations 2.5 years later

1. ***Being able to be afford the uncertainty associated with risk is a privilege***

When plan B is not being able to put food on the table or not being able to afford daycare, choosing risk doesnt feel right in any shape or form. To able to have had the option to take a risk & afford to fail is a great blessing, whether it works out or not. 

2. ***Uncertainty and Happiness is not a math equation***

I feel like for a lot of people including myself, this is the statement that needs to evaluate to true in order to take risk: 

> Happiness from certainty < The ***potential*** amount of happinesss I might gain in the future if I choose uncertainty (aka a chance to be happier) + The ***potential*** amount of unhappinesss I might gain in the future if I choose uncertainty (aka a chance to be happier) and fail

And I'd get frustrated at myself when I wouldnt take a chance even when this was the case — but luckily, our decision making skills are much more complex than that. It's ok, and we can and should put emotion into the decision making process & be kinder to ourselves.

3. ***Uncertainty is sometimes really romanticized & overhyped***

Sometimes, what we need is certainty & the comfort that comes from it — and I personally think that's completely valid. 

When contemplating / taking risk, it turns into constantly asking ourselves "how can i make/ have more ______ than i do now?" Nothing wrong with this, but I've found it's really hard to be content with the present & even harder to be grateful for it with this line of thinking. 


### final thoughts

The grass will always be greener on the otherside — it's ok for us to enjoy & be grateful for our seemingly slightly less green grass & not always be obsessed about comapring our grass to theirs. Maybe, just maybe, we'll find that the things that we've been looking for were always right here, in our own slightly less green grass.
